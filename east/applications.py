    Constructs the keyphrases relation graph based on the given texts corpus.

    The graph construction algorithm is based on the analysis of co-occurrences of key phrases

    occurs frequently enough in the same texts as the first one (that frequency is controlled
    by the referral_confidence). A keyphrase counts as occuring in a text if its matching score
    for that text ecxeeds some threshold (Mirkin, Chernyak, & Chugunova, 2012).
